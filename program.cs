            ReadAllText()
            So here is a list of methods that are pretty useful to know about these classes.

            Again this is not a complete list by any means. 
            My intention is to just give you an idea of what you can do with these classes. 
            So create Mithu is of course used to create a file.
            You also have copy delete exists to check if a file exists.
            Get the attributes which returns the attributes of the given file or move to move the file around or
            read all text which reads all the text in a file directory and directory info are very similar to file
            and file info so directory class provide static methods whereas directory info provides instance methods.

            //What is Directory and DirectoryInfo?
            //Simliar to File and FileInfo

            Move()
            GetLogicalDrives()

            Path
            We also have the path class which provides methods to work with a string that contains a file or directory path information.

            GetDirectoryName()
            GetFilename()
            GetExtension()

            /*
            So if you want to execute a small number of operations against a specific file it's more convenient

            to use these static methods so you're going to have to create a new file in file object.

            But with this static method every time we call them the operating system does some security checking

            and that can affect the performance of re - application.
